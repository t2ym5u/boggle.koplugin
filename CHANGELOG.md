# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [1.3.0] - 2026-09-30

### Added
- French dictionary goes from 47,435 to **132,778 words**, now covering 3-9
  letters instead of stopping at 7. The 3-7 letter words are the original CC0
  Scrabble-valid list; the 8- and 9-letter words come from
  `an-array-of-french-words` (MIT), normalized the same way.
- This removes the asymmetry the English dictionary work had inverted rather
  than fixed: only English could reach the longest words. Both languages now
  cover the full nine-tile draw.


## [1.2.0] - 2026-09-30

### Added
- English dictionary goes from 1,837 to **105,145 words** (3-9 letters), from
  the Public-Domain ENABLE word-game list. On the same 20 grids, findable words
  per grid go from 24.0 to 108.5 — at last the same order of magnitude as the
  French list.

### Fixed
- README advertised dictionaries for "EN, FR, DE, ES"; only EN and FR have ever
  existed.
