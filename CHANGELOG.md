# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [1.3.2] - 2026-10-07

### Fixed
- The Tools menu entry is translated again. `main.lua` took `_` from
  KOReader's `gettext`, which knows nothing of this plugin's strings, so the
  menu label stayed English while the game's own screen, which goes through
  `i18n`, was translated. `_` now comes from `i18n` here too.


## [1.3.1] - 2026-10-01

### Fixed
- Picks up game-common v1.5.0. Play statistics were recorded under a key no
  tool could match: `ReaderUI`/`FileManager:registerModule()` rewrite a plugin
  instance's `name` to `reader<id>` / `filemanager<id>` right after it is
  built, so this game's sessions were split across two rows and neither
  carried its plugin id. Rows written under the old keys are merged back on
  first read. The same release brings the `stopPlugin()` /
  `deletePluginSettings()` hooks KOReader 2026.07 calls when a plugin is
  deleted from the device (PR #15240).

  No change to this plugin's own code -- it inherits all of it from the
  shared library.

## [1.3.0] - 2026-09-30

### Added
- French dictionary goes from 47,435 to **132,778 words**, now covering 3-9
  letters instead of stopping at 7. The 3-7 letter words are the original CC0
  Scrabble-valid list; the 8- and 9-letter words come from
  `an-array-of-french-words` (MIT), normalized the same way.
- This removes the asymmetry the English dictionary work had inverted rather
  than fixed: only English could reach the longest words. Both languages now
  cover the full nine-tile draw.


## [1.2.0] - 2026-09-30

### Added
- English dictionary goes from 1,837 to **105,145 words** (3-9 letters), from
  the Public-Domain ENABLE word-game list. On the same 20 grids, findable words
  per grid go from 24.0 to 108.5 — at last the same order of magnitude as the
  French list.

### Fixed
- README advertised dictionaries for "EN, FR, DE, ES"; only EN and FR have ever
  existed.
